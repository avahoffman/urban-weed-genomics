178 of 178 individuals included, 746 of 746 loci included
Note that missing dosage information for polyploids has been replaced with randomly drawn alleles based on estimated allele frequencies assuming HWE.

Used a ploidy independent Infinite Allele Model, so the reported statistics are equivalent to Rho
Significance was tested using 999 permutations


– AMOVA summary:

Source of Variation	Nested in	%var	F-stat	F-value	Std.Dev.	c.i.2.5%	c.i.97.5%	P-value
Within Population 	--	0.278	Rho_st	0.722	--	--	--	--

Among City    	--	0.129	Rho_ct	0.129	--	--	--	0.002

Estimation of the standard deviations through jackknifing over loci was not possible.
Estimation of the 95% confidence intervals through bootstrapping over loci was not possible.
