This repository is meant to house code and supplementary material for the publication "Genetic diversity and population structure in cities is not consistent among cosmopolitan plant species" in _Molecular Ecology_ (download link coming soon). There are both [pdf rendered](Supplement.pdf) and [markdown](Supplement.md) rendered versions of this supplement.
